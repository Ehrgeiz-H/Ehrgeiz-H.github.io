# VR travel equipment introduction
## Subject
VR travel

## Motivation
With the development of the economy, more and more people choose to use their free time to travel to other cities or overseas. However, since 2020 the outbreak of Covid-19 has hampered travel, and there are people with limited mobility and financial disadvantages who would otherwise be unable to travel. In order to solve this problem, this device uses virtual reality technology to simulate any region on earth, so that users can have the experience of traveling without leaving home.
The device uses virtual reality technology to simulate all the features of any region, including natural scenery and architectures, and to enhance the usersâ€™ experience, the device can simulate the local weather in real time. In addition to the visual aspect, the device further enhances the realism of the virtual world from multiple perspectives such as hearing, smell and touch, for example, it can simulate the sound of people talking on the roads or the smell of local street food.

## Function
The users can interact with the device in a variety of ways. Users can walk around the virtual world, and if they want to learn more about a particular landscape or building, they can use ask questions using natural languages, and the device will call on its knowledge base to answer the relevant questions and give a detailed description. The user can choose to generate photos at any location, simulating the actual travel in the form of punch cards. The device can also generate random virtual passersby and configure a language system to generate statements to talk to the users based on the local language and cultural background. The device also allows users to choose different ways of touring according to the characteristics of the local landscape, for example, it can simulate the viewpoint of an aircraft or a submarine, so that the users can look down on a mountain range from an aerial viewpoint or visit a deep-sea landscape from an underwater viewpoint.

<p><b>In summary, the device provides a way for people who for various reasons are unable to physically travel to have a full travel experience at a relatively low cost.</b></p>
