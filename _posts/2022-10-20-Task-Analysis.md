# Title: VR Travel Project
Our group consists of 3 people.Each person has a specific role.

## Problem:

Since 2020 the outbreak of Covid-19 has hampered travel, and there are people with limited mobility and financial disadvantages who would be unable to travel. This device uses virtual reality technology to simulate any region on earth, so that users can have the experience of traveling without leaving home.

## Team Roles:

Website Construction：何文韬
Website layout：刘晶
Requirements Analysis：吴静容

## User Analysis:

## User class 1: a couple

Age: 8
Goal: explore the forest
Behavior: love nature, want to explore, watch science fiction movies
Background: a student in primary school

Goals: Visiting as many European countries as possible
Backgrounds: Has a bachelor degree in economics, has basic skills in using computers, never used a VR equipment before


# Task Analysis:

## Task 1:

1.	Task Scenario: （user class 1）
The couple mentioned above want to use the device concurrently, they would like to see each other’s avatar in the virtual world and interact without delay.
2.	Precondition
The couple have good internet connection and use our devices simultaneously.
3.	Goal
Our device is able to make the couple see and interact with each other’s avatar in real time and receive feedback.
4.	Exceptions
Under some circumstances, maybe due to some bugs and unstable network, the couple cannot see or hear each other’s avatar. 


## Task 2:

1.	Task Scenario: （user class 1）
Our users want to interact with the surroundings in the virtual world. for example, when user touches the wall of a building, user will receive feedbacks like vibration of controllers.
2.	Precondition
We have interactable objects in our virtual world; our devices have certain means to give stimuli to users.
3.	Goal
When user step into some certain areas or touches objects, our devices can give appropriate feedbacks to our user.
4.	Exceptions
Maybe due to some network issues, user cannot see the objects but is able to receive feedbacks.


## Task 3:
1.	Task scenario（user class 2）
Jerry wants to experience free flight and diving in the system, and freely explore the scenarios.
2.	Precondition
Our device supports the function of free exploration in the scenario, and we provide a training scenario for the use of VR devices.
3.	Goal
Our device supports the user to move in any direction in 3D space.
4.	Exceptions
The user may not be flexibly rotate 180° or more.


## Task 4:
1.	Task scenario（user class 2）
Tom wants to fish at the lake and experience the joy of catching fish.
2.	Precondition
We first provide a comfortable seat for the user, and design the fishing scenario, which consists of the fishing rod, fish, lake and so on.
3.	Goal
Triggering fishing event in the VR scenario every period of time.
4.	Exceptions
For a more realistic experience, the user need to use different forces for different sizes of fish, which may be difficult to achieve through our devices.


## Task 5:
1.	Task Scenarios（user class 3）
Zhang San wants to visit London and chat with local people in English, however, since she can’t really go to London because of Covid, she intends to use our equipment to have a virtual experience.
2.	Goal
The equipment should be able to generate virtual residents that can have natural conversations with users. The conversations’ topics can include culture, food, education etc.
3.	Preconditions
The equipment should be able to generate random virtual human figures, and it should also have a natural language processing system, which can understand users’ meanings and give proper feedbacks in natural languages. 
4.	Subtasks
Generating virtual figures; recognizing human’s voices; processing natural languages.
5.	Exceptions
Many users, like Zhang San, who are not native speakers may speak with heavy accents, the system could have trouble in processing different pronunciations, which can lead to misunderstandings and unnatural conversations. 
6.	Time constraints
Due to the enormous computation required in natural language processing, this task must be limited to three hours.
7.	Frequency of use
Occasionally.


## Task 6:
1.	Task Scenarios（user class 3）
Zhang San would like to have an aerial view of famous mountains. The view should simulate the actual perspective of a flying plane.
2.	Goal
Generate aerial views that can give users a virtual experience of appreciating natural beauties from a plane.
3.	Preconditions
The equipment should be able to search for a large amount of images from different databases, and has a visual process system that can merge these images into panoramas.
4.	Subtasks
Search for specific images that can be concatenated into aerial view pictures.
5.	Exceptions
If the images are of extremely high qualities, it may take longer than expected time to process, which can make it hard for the users to have immersive experiences.
6.	Time constraints
This task should be limited to six hours.
7.	Frequency of use
Often.
